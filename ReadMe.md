SE-car-rental-project

Car Rental system that takes reservations, CRUD operations on vehicles, employee authorization and customer tracking.

The FrontEnd works without the Spring Security additions we made(such backend is available in the dev branch) and so we needed 2 different folders for the back end (the other, with Security implemented is in the dev_tensae branch).

For the front end, 
npm i react-scripts
npm i antd

Have the backend (with out security running) running on port 
and run `npm start` on the front-end  and it should be up on localhost:3000
